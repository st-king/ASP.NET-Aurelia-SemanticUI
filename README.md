 * If the sample/template you're trying to run has a file called `webpack.config.vendor.js` at its root, run `webpack --config webpack.config.vendor.js`. It it has a file called `webpack.config.js`, run `webpack` (no args). You might need to install webpack first, by running `npm install -g webpack`.
